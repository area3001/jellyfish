The board we're using is the [ESP12_DEV](https://github.com/phyx-be/ESP12_DEV) board.\r\n![DEV Board](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/area3001/jellyfish/master/img/ESP12_DEV00_0.jpg)\r\n\r\nThe pixels used in Jellyfish feature a LPD6803 IC paired with 4 RGB LEDs each to improve the pixel brightness. The pixels are arranged in a 8x8 configuration to create a large (approx. 1m by 1m) LED panel. the panel itself is fabricated using a thick 18mm piece of MDF wood for the back side, and 4mm thick MDF for the cross sections. The side panels and top panel will be made from opaque acryl.\r\n\r\n![Pixel](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/area3001/jellyfish/master/img/LPD6803_PIXEL.jpg)\r\n![Panel closeup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/area3001/jellyfish/master/img/PANEL_CLOSEUP.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Software\r\n\r\n#### Client\r\n\r\nThanks to the folks from the [ESP8266 Community Forum](https://github.com/esp8266) we've been able to program the ESP12E using the Arduino IDE resulting in an easy to understand and easy to modify program.\r\n\r\n#### Server\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-35123769-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
